# Traffic-Signal-Classification-using-CNN
A Basic Deep Learning Project using Keras as Tensorflow Backend                   
Notebook used : Google Colab           
(Tensorflow Version 1.x Used)

This Simple Project is the foundation of Self-Driving Cars.

1> In this Project, we have been provided with images of traffic signs and the goal is to train a Deep Network to classify them.          
2> The dataset contains 43 different classes of images.                
3> The Network used is called Le-Net which is a part of Convolutional Neural Networks.                     

To Predict : The Type/Class of Traffic Sign Provided
